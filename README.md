# Kadronk's Unity Utils

This repository is a collection of Unity packages that I and my colleagues often use, or will reuse.  
Each root folder of this repo is a Unity package. They contain single-purpose frameworks and editor tools.

### How to import a package

1. Make sure that you have Git installed and correctly set up on your computer.
2. In Unity, go to the Package Manager
3. Click `+` > "Add package from Git URL..."
4. Type `https://github.com/Kadronk/UnityUtils.git?path=/NAME_OF_ROOT_FOLDER`, and replace `NAME_OF_ROOT_FOLDER` with the folder name of the package you want.  
You can't import the whole repository at once.

### License
